h1. "Resauce Framework":http://github.com/mikekelly/Resauce

Resauce is a PHP library/framework which extends Zend Framework. It is intended as a lightweight tool for building RESTful HTTP interfaces.

h2. Introduction

The idea is that every URI pattern is routed to a controller; i.e. a controller is a Resource.

Example Routes:

'/blogposts', array('controller' => 'blogposts')

'/blogposts/:post', array('controller' => 'blogpost')

'/blogposts/:post/comments', array('controller' => 'blogpostcomments')


A Resauce controller invokes the action which corresponds to the HTTP Method of a given request

i.e.

* GET >> getAction()
* PUT >> putAction()
* POST >> postAction()
* DELETE >> deleteAction()
* HEAD >> headAction()
* OPTIONS >> optionsAction()

If a request is made to a resource which does not have an action implemented for the relevant HTTP method, then the server will automatically respond with a 405 Method Not Allowed response code, and a short JSON entity body.
