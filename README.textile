h1. "Resauce Framework":http://github.com/mikekelly/Resauce

Resauce is a small extension to Zend Framework. It gives you a lightweight framework for building RESTful HTTP interfaces with PHP.

h2. Introduction

The main idea is to treat each controller as a Resource; i.e. a controller is responsible for *one resource*. This is distint from other solutions (such as the REST components included in ZF itself) where a controller is responsible for both collection and item resources.

Example Routes:

'/blog' >> BlogController

'/blog/:post' >> BlogPostController

'/blog/:post/comments' >> BlogPostCommentsController

A route in a Resauce application simply maps a URI pattern to a Resauce controller - no controller action should ever be specified in a route. Instead - controller actions are 'routed' according to the HTTP method of a given request.

i.e.

* GET >> getAction()
* PUT >> putAction()
* POST >> postAction()
* DELETE >> deleteAction()
* HEAD >> headAction()
* OPTIONS >> optionsAction()

If a request is routed to a resauce controller which does not have an action implemented for the given HTTP method, then the Resauce will automatically respond with a 405 Method Not Allowed response code.
